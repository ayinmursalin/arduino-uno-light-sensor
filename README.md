This project is created as my journey on Learning IoT.

## Description
Things
- Arduino Uno
- LCD with i2c
- LDR Module

LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) Module or, photoresistor, is a type of resistor where resitant value change with intensity of light.
This module has 4 pin:
- VCC
- GND
- DO (Digital)
- AO (Analog)

Digital Value is to dectect is there any light emitted to Sensor, which we can control the threshold from Potentiometer on the module.
While Analog Value is calculate to amount of Light emitted, where lower value means high intensity of light and vice versa.
